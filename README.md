# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

PROJECT TITLE
Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early detection and prevention crucial in reducing its impact. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and costly, often requiring extensive clinical testing. The challenge is to develop a predictive model that can accurately and efficiently assess the likelihood of heart disease based on key health indicators. This project aims to create a Heart Disease Prediction System using Logistic Regression, a machine learning technique, to analyze patient data and predict the probability of heart disease. By utilizing this model, healthcare providers can identify at-risk individuals early, enabling timely intervention and improving patient outcomes.

DATASET INFORMATION
The dataset used for this project comprises various attributes, including age, sex, cholesterol, chest pain, blood pressure etc. The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle, with full credit to the original creator and uploader. The dataset includes the following features:

'age': The age of the patient in years.

'sex': The patient's gender (1 = male, 0 = female).

'cp' (chest pain type): The type of chest pain experienced by the patient: 0: Typical angina 1: Atypical angina 2: Non-anginal pain 3: Asymptomatic

'trestbps' (resting blood pressure): The patient’s resting blood pressure (measured in mm Hg).

'chol' (cholesterol): The patient’s serum cholesterol level (measured in mg/dl).

'fbs' (fasting blood sugar): Fasting blood sugar level > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).

'restecg' (resting electrocardiographic results): Results of the resting electrocardiogram (ECG): 0: Normal 1: ST-T wave abnormality (e.g., T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression) 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy

'thalach' (maximum heart rate achieved): The maximum heart rate achieved during a stress test.

'exang' (exercise-induced angina): Whether exercise-induced angina (chest pain) occurs (1 = yes, 0 = no).

'oldpeak': Depression in the ST segment during exercise relative to rest (measured in mm).

'slope' (slope of the peak exercise ST segment): The slope of the ST segment during peak exercise: 0: Upsloping 1: Flat 2: Downsloping

'ca' (number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy): The number of major vessels (0-3) that are visible after fluoroscopy (X-ray imaging).

'thal' (thalassemia): Thalassemia diagnosis: 1: Normal 2: Fixed defect 3: Reversible defect

'target': The target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease).
